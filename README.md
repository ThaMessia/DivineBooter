# DivineBooter

DivineBooter is a special type of tool that attacks Minecraft servers sending packets and bots.
Why should you choose DivineBooter over other booters?
```yml
1): Fast & Powerful.
2): Open-Source.
3): Frequently updated.
4): Comfortable design.
5): Uses raw Minecraft protocol instead of slow libraries.
6): Customizable attacks.
7): Italian quality.
```

Let's see how can we perform an attack using DivineBooter. 
First of all, after opening it, we should see an interface like this:
```css
DivineBooter
> 
```
Generally, we could type help to see all the commands, but we will go straight into attack.

Type 'attack' and type the informations you have to type. Then, the specified Minecdaft server will soon die.
As the attack starts, you will see something like this:
```yml
Sending bots...
```
PRO TIP: If you want the specified Minecraft server to crash instantly, do not use proxies, as they are very slow.

Run this on a botnet or a VPS and you have your secure Minecraft hacking environment!
